<h4> Welcome to the Marvel Comics MarketPlace<h4>

<p> Marvel Comics MarketPlace is a application where Marvel fans can come together
to buy, share, trade or sell their favorite comics from their collections. We have developed 
a comprehensive catalog of over 40,000 digital comics for our users to view or share with 
their friends and have listed over 1000 of your favorite Marvel heroes and villains to search by.
We designed the app for users to search efficiently for your favorite comic or just browsing 
for a new one to add to your collection. We have comics for all of our users and invite you
to use our free app for all your comic book interests.

To use the Marvel Comics Marketplace you can create a profile using your Githib username 
and password or you can browse comics without having a profile. You can start your search
by searching for your favorite Marvel characters by selecting the Characters tab.
It will take you to Characters page where you can search by the First letter of the Marvel
characters name and show all the characters in the catalog. A user can then click 
on the characters image and view information on that character and save that character to 
their collection of favorite characters.

Next the user can search through our catalog of comics by selecting the Comics option.
Here we have our entire catalog of Marvel Comics where a user can view and save their favorite
comics to their collection. A description and title of the comic is also displayed once the 
user selects a comic from the list. 
</p>
<p>Also users can view their collection by selecting the Collections option. 
If a user isnt signed it it will display the public collection. If they are 
signed in it will display their collection.
