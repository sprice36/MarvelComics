The deadliest agent in the Marvel Universe has finally gotten out of the spy game, and she's not asking for much, just a life of her own. When a sudden assassination attempt provides a harsh reality check, the former Soviet agent tracks a string of international killings that will lead her back to a Russia she can barely recognize.

Kicking things off with the biggest heist they’ve ever tried, we join Star-Lord, Rocket Raccoon and company as they blast their way through the galaxy, the peacekeepers of the Nova Corps hot on their tails. And once they find themselves caught in a war between The Collector and The Grandmaster, there will hardly be time to explain why Groot can’t grow any bigger, what Gamora is searching for or why Drax has sworn off violence! But don’t worry, we will — with a new twice-monthly schedule, All-New Guardians of the Galaxy has space for ALL your Marvel Cosmic needs!"}],"resourceURI":"http://gateway.marvel.com/v1/public/comics/61514","urls":[{"type":"detail","url":"http://marvel.com/comics/issue/61514/all-new_guardians_of_the_galaxy_2017_2?utm_campaign=apiRef&utm_source=25108cac40f2a2d83083f060021d499e"},{"type":"purchase","url":"http://comicstore.marvel.com/All-New-Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-2/digital-comic/44731?utm_campaign=apiRef&utm_source=25108cac40f2a2d83083f060021d499e"},{"type":"reader","url":"http://marvel.com/digitalcomics/view.htm?iid=44731&utm_campaign=apiRef&utm_source=25108cac40f2a2d83083f060021d499e"},{"type":"inAppLink","url":"https://applink.marvel.com/issue/44731?utm_campaign=apiRef&utm_source=25108cac40f2a2d83083f060021d499e"}],"series":{"resourceURI":"http://gateway.marvel.com/v1/public/series/23058","name":"All-New Guardians of the Galaxy (2017 - Present)"},"variants":[],"collections":[],"collectedIssues":[],"dates":[{"type":"onsaleDate","date":"2017-05-24T00:00:00-0400"},{"type":"focDate","date":"2017-05-01T00:00:00-0400"},{"type":"unlimitedDate","date":"2017-11-27T00:00:00-0500"},{"type":"digitalPurchaseDate","date":"2017-05-24T00:00:00-0400"}],"prices":[{"type":"printPrice","price":3.99},{"type":"digitalPurchasePrice","price":3.99}],"thumbnail":{"path":"http://i.annihil.us/u/prod/marvel/i/mg/6/90/591c9b19ca526","extension":"jpg"},"images":[{"path":"http://i.annihil.us/u/prod/marvel/i/mg/6/90/591c9b19ca526","extension":"jpg"}],"creators":{"available":4,"collectionURI":"http://gateway.marvel.com/v1/public/comics/61514/creators","items":[{"resourceURI":"http://gateway.marvel.com/v1/public/creators/11680","name":"Gerry Duggan","role":"writer"},{"resourceURI":"http://gateway.marvel.com/v1/public/creators/12979","name":"Aaron Kuder","role":"penciler (cover)"},{"resourceURI":"http://gateway.marvel.com/v1/public/creators/11561","name":"Ive Svorcina","role":"colorist (cover)"},{"resourceURI":"http://gateway.marvel.com/v1/public/creators/8822","name":"Jordan White","role":"editor"}],"returned":4},"characters":{"available":1,"collectionURI":"http://gateway.marvel.com/v1/public/comics/61514/characters","items":[{"resourceURI":"http://gateway.marvel.com/v1/public/characters/1011299","name":"Guardians of the Galaxy"}],"returned":1},"stories":{"available":2,"collectionURI":"http://gateway.marvel.com/v1/public/comics/61514/stories","items":[{"resourceURI":"http://gateway.marvel.com/v1/public/stories/133457","name":"cover from Guardians of the Galaxy (2017) #2","type":"cover"},{"resourceURI":"http://gateway.marvel.com/v1/public/stories/133458","name":"story from Guardians of the Galaxy (2017) #2","type":"interiorStory"}],"returned":2},"events":{"available":0,"collectionURI":"http://gateway.marvel.com/v1/public/comics/61514/events","items":[],"returned":0}},{"id":61520,"digitalId":45535,"title":"All-New Guardians of the Galaxy (2017) #8","issueNumber":8,"variantDescription":"","description":"Place your bets as Star-Lord takes on Talonar of the Raptors over a long-lost cosmic artifact!

But don’t worry, we will — with a new twice-monthly schedule, All-New Guardians of the Galaxy has space for ALL your Marvel Cosmic needs!"}],"resourceURI":"http://gateway.marvel.com/v1/public/comics/61513","urls":[{"type":"detail","url":"http://marvel.com/comics/issue/61513/all-new_guardians_of_the_galaxy_2017_1?utm_campaign=apiRef&utm_source=25108cac40f2a2d83083f060021d499e"},{"type":"purchase","url":"http://comicstore.marvel.com/All-New-Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-1/digital-comic/44730?utm_campaign=apiRef&utm_source=25108cac40f2a2d83083f060021d499e"},{"type":"reader","url":"http://marvel.com/digitalcomics/view.htm?iid=44730&utm_campaign=apiRef&utm_source=25108cac40f2a2d83083f060021d499e"},{"type":"inAppLink","url":"https://applink.marvel.com/issue/44730?utm_campaign=apiRef&utm_source=25108cac40f2a2d83083f060021d499e"}],"series":{"resourceURI":"http://gateway.marvel.com/v1/public/series/23058","name":"All-New Guardians of the Galaxy (2017 - Present)"},"variants":[],"collections":[],"collectedIssues":[],"dates":[{"type":"onsaleDate","date":"2017-05-03T00:00:00-0400"},{"type":"focDate","date":"2017-04-10T00:00:00-0400"},{"type":"unlimitedDate","date":"2017-11-06T00:00:00-0500"},{"type":"digitalPurchaseDate","date":"2017-05-03T00:00:00-0400"}],"prices":[{"type":"printPrice","price":3.99},{"type":"digitalPurchasePrice","price":3.99}],"thumbnail":{"path":"http://i.annihil.us/u/prod/marvel/i/mg/6/30/5900a84360ddf","extension":"jpg"},"images":[{"path":"http://i.annihil.us/u/prod/marvel/i/mg/6/30/5900a84360ddf","extension":"jpg"}],"creators":{"available":5,"collectionURI":"http://gateway.marvel.com/v1/public/comics/61513/creators","items":[{"resourceURI":"http://gateway.marvel.com/v1/public/creators/11680","name":"Gerry Duggan","role":"writer"},{"resourceURI":"http://gateway.marvel.com/v1/public/creators/12979","name":"Aaron Kuder","role":"inker (cover)"},{"resourceURI":"http://gateway.marvel.com/v1/public/creators/12980","name":"Vc Cory Petit","role":"letterer"},{"resourceURI":"http://gateway.marvel.com/v1/public/creators/11561","name":"Ive Svorcina","role":"colorist (cover)"},{"resourceURI":"http://gateway.marvel.com/v1/public/creators/8822","name":"Jordan White","role":"editor"}],"returned":5},"characters":{"available":1,"collectionURI":"http://gateway.marvel.com/v1/public/comics/61513/characters","items":[{"resourceURI":"http://gateway.marvel.com/v1/public/characters/1011299","name":"Guardians of the Galaxy"}],"returned":1},"stories":{"available":2,"collectionURI":"http://gateway.marvel.com/v1/public/comics/61513/stories","items":[{"resourceURI":"http://gateway.marvel.com/v1/public/stories/133455","name":"cover from All-New Guardians of the Galaxy (2017) #1","type":"cover"},{"resourceURI":"http://gateway.marvel.com/v1/public/stories/133456","name":"story from Guardians of the Galaxy (2017) #1","type":"interiorStory"}],"returned":2},"events":{"available":0,"collectionURI":"http://gateway.marvel.com/v1/public/comics/61513/events","items":[],"returned":0}},{"id":61523,"digitalId":46038,"title":"All-New Guardians of the Galaxy (2017) #11","issueNumber":11,"variantDescription":"","description":"The Nova Corps…the peace keepers of the Galaxy, charged with maintaining order, serving and protecting the sentient peoples who make it their home.
